"Let there be Linux" - A brief guide to using Linux



(inspired by "Let There be Rock" - AC/DC)



"In the beginning
 Back in 1971
 Users didn't know about time-sharing systems
 And all that OS 
 The IBM man had big blue
 The VAX man has VMS
 No one know what command prompt was
 But Kernighan/Ritchie had the code
 They said

 Let there be UNIX
 There was a file system
 Let there be vi 
 There was text
 Let there be 'more'
 There was more
 Let there by lpr 
 There was paper
 Ohhh, let there be UNIX
 Let there be Linux

 And it came to pass
 That Linus Torvalds was born
 And all across the world
 Every computer student 
 Was coding up a storm
 And the coders got famous 
 and the developers got rich (too rich)
 and in every computer lab
 There was a star
 With seven compile time errors
 There were 15 million fingers
 Learning how to type commands
 And you could hear the fingers pecking
 And this is what they had to say:

 Let there be UNIX
 files
 text
 lpr 

Ohhh , let there be UNIX

One night in a lab called H813
There was a 92 line coder
And the code was good, and the code was hard
and the coder turned to the class and she said to the lab

Let there be UNIX
Let there be Linux
Let there be Linux
We don't need no Windows
We don't need no blue screens of death
Hey Bill, leave Linus alone
All in all you were just another line of code in the program. "



Quick Guide to working with Linux on the ENCS Linux systems
--------------------------------------------------


1. Download and install PuTTY on your Windows PC


2. Once you have remotely logged in to the
   ENCS Linux server (login.encs.concordia.ca)
   you will be in your so called 'home directory'.
   This document shows how to access material in
   a world readable public directory in
   /home/t/ted/PUBLIC/COEN313 as an example. The
   steps contained within this guide can be be applied
   to access other directories (provided the file permissions
   allow for it)


Here is a typical set of commands to access
the material in /home/t/ted/PUBLIC/COEN313.
In what follows, the "ted@grace ~ 5:14pm >"
is an example of what is know as the Linux command
prompt, your prompt appear different. Linux commands
are entered AFTER the prompt. 

I shall use CAPITALS for explanatory comments.



ted@grace ~ 4:26pm >         cd /home/t/ted/PUBLIC
--------------------------    ---------------------
 Linux command prompt            a command line


cd MEANS TO CHANGE DIRECTORY , the general form 
is :


cd    directory_name





NEXT, WE USE the ls COMMAND TO OBTAIN A DIRECTORY
LISTING (to see what is inside /home/t/ted/PUBLIC)  


ted@grace ~/PUBLIC 4:28pm >ls
COEN212  COEN244  COEN313  COEN317  COMP228   LAYOUT   PROJECT  UNIX_TUTORIAL
COEN243  COEN311  COEN316  COEN451  COMP5201  MECH215  SOEN228



The -al option to ls command LISTS ALL FILES AND DIRECTORIES
USING THE "LONG" FORMAT:



ted@grace ~/PUBLIC 4:28pm >ls -al

----------

these are the so called file permissions. 
User 'ted' can read , write, and execute ,
everyone else can only read and execute.
'x' (execute ) permission is required in order to be
able to cd into a directory. 'r' (read) permission
is required in order to read (or copy) the contents
of a file, and 'w' permission is needed to change
the file (or to delete) the file. If the permissions
start with the letter 'd', it means the listed name
is a directory (as opposed to a simple file).
You will note that some directories do not have
world read-execute permission.



WE NOW GO INTO THE COEN313 directory:


ted@grace ~/PUBLIC 4:29pm >cd COEN313
ted@grace COEN313 4:30pm >ls
DD_flow_tutorial.pdf  LABS  TUTORIAL



To change into the LABS directory and
list its contents:


ed@grace COEN313 4:30pm >cd LABS
ted@grace LABS 4:31pm >ls -al
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 6 ted ted 4096 Mar  5 20:17 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 ted ted 4096 Jan 14  2020 ..
drwxr-xr-x 2 ted ted 4096 Jan 14  2020 Lab1
drwxr-xr-x 2 ted ted 4096 Jan 31  2020 Lab2
drwxr-xr-x 2 ted ted 4096 Feb 14  2020 Lab3
drwxr-xr-x 2 ted ted 4096 Mar  5 20:17 Lab4


To change into the Lab1 directory:


ted@grace LABS 4:31pm >cd Lab1
ted@grace Lab1 4:32pm >ls
lab1.pdf


NOTE: The labs in this document may not correspond to the
Fall 2020 labs. This document merely serves as a short
tutorial on how to navigate within directories in Linux.


to go one level UP in a directory structure, 
simply do cd ..

For example, if we are in /home/t/ted/PUBLIC/COEN313/LABS,
the  cd .. command :

ted@grace LABS 4:34pm >cd ..
ted@grace COEN313 4:34pm >


brings us back to :

/home/t/ted/PUBLIC/COEN313



to see the contents of an ASCII text file on the screen use
the 'more' command , this command displays one screenful
of text on the screen, and waits until you press the SPACEBAR
key to show more - hence the name of the command. When the entire
file has been displayed, control returns to the command prompt.j


We will use the more command to view the contents of a sample
text file :

ted@grace COEN313 4:36pm >more this_is_a_text_file.txt 

this is a sample text file.

ted@grace COEN313 4:37pm >




Sending email from the command line:
-------------------------------------



The easiest way to send a file by email is with the 'mail command:

"mail recipients_email_address <  name_of_file "  (then press Enter)

as in:



ted@grace COEN313 4:37pm >mail ted < this_is_a_text_file.txt

if you want to include the specified file as an attachment, use
the -a option to the mail command :

ted@grace COEN313 4:39pm >mail -a this_is_a_text_file.txt  ted@ece.concordia.ca

YOU WILL BE ASKED TO ENTER A SUBJECT:

Subject: long live linux

once you've entered the subject, you can type the body
of the mail , and then press CTRL-D keys at the same time
to send the mail. 


LEARNING MORE ABOUT LINUX
----------------------------


There is a tutorial abour 20 pages long in;

/home/t/ted/PUBLIC/UNIX_TUTORIAL/ECE_UNIX_guide


I suggest you use the 'more' command to read it.
Or better yet, email it yo yourself using the 'mail'
command and read it at home. Note: some of the commands
contained in the ECE_UNIX_guide have since become depracated
due to various system changes since it was written, but the
basic Linux commands contained therin are still valid.


There are also many good, well-written books written
on the subject of Linux. The best way is to install
it on your system (make your PC a dual-boot Linux-Windows
system) and start using it.
