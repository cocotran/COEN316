For COEN 313 Lab 4 (and any design which makes use of synchronous elements
with a clock input), we have two choices as to how to specify where the
clock source is to come from:

1) make use of the dedicated clock oscillator circuit available on
   most FPGA development boards. For example, on the Nexys A7 board
   we normally make use of in the lab, there is a 100 MHz clock circuit
   which is connected to FPGA pin E3 (the Master XDC file gives this information).

   So, all that is required is to specify that the clock input port be constrained
   to pin E3 in the .xdc file :

  # clock from board 100 MHz
    set_property -dict { PACKAGE_PIN E3    IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 } [get_ports { clk }];


A standard TCL synthesis script is then used to synthesize the design.

Obviously, if we were in an actual lab environment, using a 100MHz clock does
not allow for one to manually observe the circuit behaviour using LEDs and human
eyes ( an logic analyzer and some automatic test equipment would be required).
This technique is appropriate when one is testing a "real-world" implementation.

2) We can use one of the 16 available switches on the FPGA board to use
   as the clock input. This is what would be done hade we been in the in-person
   lab setting. We would simply flip the switch up and down to manually toggle the
   clock input. When using this approach, we need to slighly modify the .xdc file
   to tell the Xilinx Vivado tools to allow for using 'non-dedicated routing resources'
   to route the clock signal from the IO pad connected to the whichever switch is
   specified as the clock using non-dedicated routing resources. All that is required
   is the addition of the following PROPERTY in the .xdc file:

# clock from  a regular switch on board
# set this property to FALSE to allow use of non-dedicated routing resources
# to route clock IBUF when using  a regular switch input (for manual single-step
# clocking of the FPGA board in a lab setting, if not set to FALSE, placement ERRORS
# occur during the execution of the TCL synthesis script.

set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets clk]

# we use a regular switch on the board as the clock input , useful for
# manual clocking in single-step board for testing of the downloaded design
# in a lab environment
#
set_property -dict { PACKAGE_PIN R13    IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 } [get_ports { clk }];


The Vivado tools use special , dedicated, low-delay routing resources to route
a clock input from a FPGA pin to all the clock inputs of all the synchronous elements
within the design. This is done to minimize clock skew (skew refers to the difference
in arrival time of the rising clock edge due to propagation and routing delays ).
